  <h4 class="card-title about">Laura Walker</h4>
  <p class="card-text">Laura Walker has known that writing is her calling ever since she was nine years old. A favorite maxim is: “If it isn’t written, it isn’t real.” Since earning her MFA in creative writing (with an emphasis in poetry), Laura has used her wordsmithing skills as an editor, web content developer, marketing manager, award-winning business plan writer, English teacher, published poet and overachieving smartass. As an active member of Alcoholics Anonymous since 2008, our Master Gunner loves her life of sobriety and has learned to chill her type-A down to a type-A-minus/B+ and be OK with not running the world. Her friends, family, colleagues and students appreciate this very much.</p>
